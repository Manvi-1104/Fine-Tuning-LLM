# Fine-Tuning-LLM
Fine-tuning existing openai-community gpt2 model for Medical Question Answering

The .ipynb file has the code for fine-tuning the gpt2 model and is fine-tuned on a medical dataset taken from Kaggle. It's preferable to use GPU for training the model as it requires much computation. The output is not very accurate but much better than my previous trial outputs.
